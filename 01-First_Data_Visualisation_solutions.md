# Data Visualisation


## Solutions

For this first series of exercises, we will analyze the marketing performance of a Facebook campaign. The company XYZ spent a certain amount of its budget with the goal of increasing the number of forms filled out on their website.

The company's marketing team provided you with four files corresponding to the campaign performance according to:



1. The devices used
2. Days of the week
3. Demographics (age & sex)
4. Hours of the day

Your goal will be to understand the data and draw useful recommendations for the company.
